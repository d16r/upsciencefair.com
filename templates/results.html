            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>This section should give a objective (unbiased) representation of trends, values, and calculations using charts, diagrams, graphs and other models to describe to the reader the data collected. In order to adequately do so, the results section needs to include these figures that are properly labeled with units for clear interpretation. Trends, values, and calculations should be visually shown through figures, but also reported in writing using explicit statements that capture the studentâ€™s understanding of the data presented.</p>
