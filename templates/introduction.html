            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The introduction is perhaps the most important part of the lab report because it lays out exactly what you are experimenting, why you are performing the experiment and what you predict the result will be. Therefore it must include all of the following parts and answer the questions under each subsection.</p>
